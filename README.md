# Network-Analysis-with-R

Network analysis refers to the study of relationships between different entities, such as people, organizations, or concepts.
It involves representing these relationships as a network or a graph, with entities as nodes and their connections as edges.

Network analysis can provide insights into how entities interact with each other, how information flows, and how the network as a whole functions.

For this exercise, we will be analyzing the House Stark main characters in the Game of Thrones Series.

Game of Thrones is a popular TV show where Nine noble families wage war against each other in order
to gain control over the mythical land of Westeros. In this analysis, we focus on the major characters in
House Stark - Arya, Jon and Sansa Stark.
